ABSTRACT = {Image classification has always been a hot research direction in the world, and the emergence of deep learning has promoted the development of this field. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gradually become the mainstream algorithm for image classification since 2012, and the CNN architecture applied to other visual recognition tasks (such as object detection, object localization, and semantic segmentation) is generally derived from the network architecture in image classification. In the wake of these successes, CNN-based methods have emerged in remote sensing image scene classification and achieved advanced classification accuracy. In this review, which focuses on the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art (SOAT) network architectures. Along the way, we analyze (1) the basic structure of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the basic network layers of CNNs, (2) the classic predecessor network models, (3) the recent SOAT network algorithms, (4) comprehensive comparison of various image classification methods mentioned in this article. Finally, we have also summarized the main analysis and discussion in this article, as well as introduce some of the current trends.},

abstract = {Day by day, biometric-based systems play a vital role in our daily lives. This paper proposed an intelligent assistant intended to identify emotions via voice message. A biometric system has been developed to detect human emotions based on voice recognition and control a few electronic peripherals for alert actions. This proposed smart assistant aims to provide a support to the people through buzzer and light emitting diodes (LED) alert signals and it also keep track of the places like households, hospitals and remote areas, etc. The proposed approach is able to detect seven emotions: worry, surprise, neutral, sadness, happiness, hate and love. The key elements for the implementation of speech emotion recognition are voice processing, and once the emotion is recognized, the machine interface automatically detects the actions by buzzer and LED. The proposed system is trained and tested on various benchmark datasets, i.e., Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) database, Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus (TIMIT) database, Emotional Speech database (Emo-DB) database and evaluated based on various parameters, i.e., accuracy, error rate, and time. While comparing with existing technologies, the proposed algorithm gave a better error rate and less time. Error rate and time is decreased by 19.79%, 5.13 s. for the RAVDEES dataset, 15.77%, 0.01 s for the Emo-DB dataset and 14.88%, 3.62 for the TIMIT database. The proposed model shows better accuracy of 81.02% for the RAVDEES dataset, 84.23% for the TIMIT dataset and 85.12% for the Emo-DB dataset compared to Gaussian Mixture Modeling(GMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model.}

title = "A deep-learning approach to realizing functionality in nanoelectronic devices",
abstract = "Many nanoscale devices require precise optimization to function. Tuning them to the desired operation regime becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming when the number of terminals and couplings grows. Imperfections and device-to-device variations hinder optimization that uses physics-based models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can model various complex physical phenomena but, so far, are mainly used as predictive tools. Here, we propose a generic deep-learning approach to efficiently optimize complex, multi-terminal nanoelectronic devices for desired functionality. We demonstrate our approach for realizing functionality in a disordered network of dopant atoms in silicon. We model the input–output characteristics of the device with a DNN, and subsequently optimize control parameters in the DNN model through gradient descent to realize various classification tasks. When the corresponding control settings are applied to the physical device, the resulting functionality is as predicted by the DNN model. We expect our approach to contribute to fast, in situ optimization of complex (quantum) nanoelectronic devices.",

abstract = {Driven frustrated materials evolve via sequences of transitions between metastable states, associated with the flipping of one or more material bits called hysterons. Interactions between hysterons are key for obtaining and understanding complex pathways, yet their control has remained elusive. Here, we uncover a general geometric mechanism that yields controllable hysteron interactions. We characterize the resulting pathways and leverage our insights to fabricate metamaterials with targeted pathways that materialize counting, pattern generation, and pattern recognition. Our results open a route toward material-based sequential computing. The complex sequential response of frustrated materials results from the interactions between material bits called hysterons. Hence, a central challenge is to understand and control these interactions, so that materials with targeted pathways and functionalities can be realized. Here, we show that hysterons in serial configurations experience geometrically controllable antiferromagnetic-like interactions. We create hysteron-based metamaterials that leverage these interactions to realize targeted pathways, including those that break the return point memory property, characteristic of independent or weakly interacting hysterons. We uncover that the complex response to sequential driving of such strongly interacting hysteron-based materials can be described by finite state machines. We realize information processing operations such as string parsing in materia, and outline a general framework to uncover and characterize the FSMs for a given physical system. Our work provides a general strategy to understand and control hysteron interactions, and opens a broad avenue toward material-based information processing.}}

abstract = {Abstract Mitigating the energy requirements of artificial intelligence requires novel physical substrates for computation. Phononic metamaterials have vanishingly low power dissipation and hence are a prime candidate for green, always-on computers. However, their use in machine learning applications has not been explored due to the complexity of their design process. Current phononic metamaterials are restricted to simple geometries (e.g., periodic and tapered) and hence do not possess sufficient expressivity to encode machine learning tasks. A non-periodic phononic metamaterial, directly from data samples, that can distinguish between pairs of spoken words in the presence of a simple readout nonlinearity is designed and fabricated, hence demonstrating that phononic metamaterials are a viable avenue towards zero-power smart devices.},
